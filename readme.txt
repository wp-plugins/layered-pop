Create multi-layers animated popup.

== Description ==

Internet is full of boring popups. So, it's a time to break this trend. That's why I created "Layered Pop". With this plugin you can realize your imagination and make unique multi-layers popup window for your website. You can create multiple layers with whatever-you-want content and add custom transitions/animations for each layer. You can raise popup window on page load or show it on click event. Make your website more attractive and pay users attention to certain stuff.

1. Upload folder "layered-pop" (and its content) into your WordPress plugin folder (normally it is /wp-content/plugins/).
