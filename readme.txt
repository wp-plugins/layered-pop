Create multi-layers animated popup.

== Description ==

Internet is full of boring popups. So, it's a time to break this trend. That's why I created "Layered Pop". With this plugin you can realize your imagination and make unique multi-layers popup window for your website. You can create multiple layers with whatever-you-want content and add custom transitions/animations for each layer. You can raise popup window on page load or show it on click event. Make your website more attractive and pay users attention to certain stuff.

If you want to create unlimited number of popups, add opt-in form and integrate it with popular autoresponders (MailChimp, GetResponse, AWeber, iContact, Campaign Monitor, MyMail), try <a href="http://layeredpopups.com/">Layered Popups</a> plugin. It has tons additional features to drive your business.

== Installation ==

1. Upload folder "layered-pop" (and its content) into your WordPress plugin folder (normally it is /wp-content/plugins/).
2. Go to WordPress dashboard and activate the plugin in plugin sections (like you do for any other plugins). Once activated, it will create a menu "Layered Pop" in left side column in the admin area. This menu contains several menu items.
3. Click left side menu "Layered Pop >>> Settings" and do required settings. There are a few of them.
4. Click left side menu "Layered Pop >>> Edit Popup". In this section you can edit your popup.
