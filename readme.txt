Create multi-layers animated popup.

== Description ==

Internet is full of boring popups. So, it's a time to break this trend. That's why I created "Layered Pop". With this plugin you can realize your imagination and make unique multi-layers popup window for your website. You can create multiple layers with whatever-you-want content and add custom transitions/animations for each layer. You can raise popup window on page load or show it on click event. Make your website more attractive and pay users attention to certain stuff.
